# PiClock

These are all the config files I changed/added to create my GPS-based stratum-1 time server on a Raspberry Pi.

I heavily relied on this blog article as a reference:

Additionally, there is a Python script and associated service file to drive a 2-line LCD display as a way to conveniently see the time.
